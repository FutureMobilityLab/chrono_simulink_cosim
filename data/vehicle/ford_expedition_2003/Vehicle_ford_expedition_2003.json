{
  // This Ford Expedition Model comes from the data published in 
  //"Real-time dynamic simulation of vehicles with electronic stability control: Modeling and validation"
  // The data in that publication provide locations in the global coordinate frame whose origin is 
  // located at ground level directly below the front axle and the vehicle centerline. The frame uses
  // x: forward, y: right, z: down. 
  //
  // Chrono uses x: forward, y: left, z: up. So the data has been adjusted accordingly.
