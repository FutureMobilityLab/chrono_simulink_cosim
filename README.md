# chrono_simulink_cosim
A minimal (in terms of source files and dependencies) project that connects [Project Chrono](https://github.com/projectchrono/chrono/tree/main) Vehicle simulation to Simulink using Project Chrono's Cosimulation module. This project aims to bring the power of Project Chrono's multi-body dynamics models of ground vehicles to interface with Matlab's Simulation easily.

## Dependencies
- Project Chrono (Vehicle, Cosimulation, Irrlicht)
  - please see [Project Chrono's Installation Guides](https://api.projectchrono.org/8.0.0/tutorial_table_of_content_install.html)
- Matlab/Simulink (Instrument Control Toolbox)
  - The instrument control toolbox is required because the Project Chrono executable has to talk to Matlab Simulink over TCP/IP.

## Getting Started
... coming soon
